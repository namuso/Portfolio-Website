		So enriching may be a bit of an over exaggeration, I am actually a relatively simple human being. I am a senior at The College of New Jersey with a major in <span class="headerFont">Computer Science</span>. I like to play sports and videogames, and I will never turn down a good RomCom.<br>
		<br>
		But you probably are not here to learn about my passion for Romantic Comedies, so let's get into the good stuff. I like to <span class="headerFont">code</span>, <span class="headerFont">design interfaces</span>, and <span class="headerFont">solve puzzles</span>. Oh, and did I mention I like to <span class="headerFont">code</span>?<br>
		<br>
		In particular, my interests consist of <span class="headerFont">Software Engineering</span>, <span class="headerFont">Front-End Development</span>, and <span class="headerFont">Artificial Intelligence</span>.<br>
		<br>
		If you are interested in learning more about what I do, please feel free to contact me!<br>
